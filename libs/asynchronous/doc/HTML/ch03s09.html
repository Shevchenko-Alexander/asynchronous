                    threaded schedulers) but also disadvantages (takes jobs from one end of the
                    queue, which means potential cache misses, more typing work). If you don't need
                    different queue types for a threadpool but want to reduce contention, multiqueue
                    schedulers are for you. A normal <code class="code">threadpool_scheduler</code> has x threads
                    and one queue, serving them. A <code class="code">multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler</code> has
                    x threads and x queues, each serving a worker thread. Each thread looks for work
                    in its queue. If it doesn't find any, it looks for work in the previous one,
                    etc. until it finds one or inspected all the queues. As all threads steal from
                    the previous queue, there is little contention. The construction of this
                    threadpool is very similar to the simple
                    <code class="code">threadpool_scheduler</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">boost::asynchronous::any_shared_scheduler_proxy&lt;&gt; scheduler = 
    boost::asynchronous::create_shared_scheduler_proxy(
                // 4 threads and 4 lockfree queues of 10 capacity
                new boost::asynchronous::multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler&lt;boost::asynchronous::lockfree_queue&lt;&gt; &gt;(4,10));</pre><p>The first argument is, as usual, the number of worker threads, which is at the
                    same time the number of queues. As for every scheduler, if the queue constructor
                    takes arguments, they come next and are forwarded to the queue.</p><p>This is the advised scheduler for standard cases as it offers lesser
                    contention and task stealing between the queues it uses for task
                    transfer.</p><p>There is a limitation, these schedulers cannot have 0 thread like their
                    single-queue counterparts.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s08.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Multiqueue Schedulers' priority&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Composite Threadpool Scheduler</td></tr></table></div></body></html>

                    layers. This is, however, easier said than done, single-threaded, but much worse
                    when layers are having their own threads. Let's say, layer A is on top and
                    basing itself on layer B. A creates B and keeps it alive as long as it lives
                    itself. A and B are each composed of hundreds of classes / objects. Our standard
                    communication is A =&gt; B, meaning A gives orders to B, which executes them. This
                    is the theory. Unfortunately, B needs to give answers, usually delayed, to A.
                    Unfortunately, A and B live in different threads. This means mutexes. Ouch. Now
                    we are forced to check every class of A and protect it. Worse, the object of A
                    getting an answer might have long been destroyed. Ouch again. What to do? We
                    could keep the object of A alive in the callback of B. But then we have a
                    dependency B -&gt; A. Ouch again, bad design. We can also hide the dependency using
                    some type erasure mechanism. We still have a logical one as B keeps its owner,
                    A, alive. Then, we can use a weak_ptr so that B does not keep A alive. But when
                    we lock, we do keep A alive. It's for a short time, but what if A is shutting
                    down? It's lost, our layered design is broken.</p><p>Asynchronous is more that a library providing a better std::async or some
                    parallel algorithms, it's first of all an architectural tool. In the above case,
                    we will decide that every layer will live in its own thread(s), called
                    schedulers in Asynchronous language. Deciding in which thread an object "lives"
                    is a key point of a good design. Then the top layer, A, will make a request to
                    B, aking a future as a result, or much better, providing a callback.
                    Asynchronous offers a callback safe in two ways: thread-safe and checking the
                    lifetime of the callback target. This callback is provided by
                        <code class="code">make_safe_callback</code>. This simple tool is a major help in making
                    a safe and efficient design.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Features of Boost.Asynchronous&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Shutting down</td></tr></table></div></body></html>

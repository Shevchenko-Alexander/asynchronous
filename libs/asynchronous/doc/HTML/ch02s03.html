Consider the
                    following class:</p><p>
                    </p><pre class="programlisting">struct Unsafe
{
  void foo()
  {
    m_mutex.lock();
    // call private member
    m_mutex.unlock();
  }
private:
  void foobar()
  {
    //we are already locked when called, do something while locked
  }
  boost::mutex m_mutex;
};            </pre><p>
                </p><p>This is called a thread-safe interface pattern. Public members lock, private
                    do not. Simple enough, right? Unfortunately, it doesn't fly.</p><p>First you have the risk of deadlock if a private member calls a public one
                    while being called from another public member. Forget to check one path of
                    execution within your class implementation and you get a nice deadlock. You'll
                    have to test every single path of execution to prove your code is correct. And
                    this at every change. Hmmm, does not sound reassuring.</p><p>Anyway, let's face it, for any complex class, where there's a mutex, there is
                    a race or a deadlock...</p><p>But even worse, the principle itself is not correct in C++. It supposes that a
                    class can protect itself. Well, no, it can't. Why? You can't protect the
                    destructor. If the object (and the mutex) gets destroyed when a thread waits for
                    it in foo(), we're toast. Ok, then we can use a shared_ptr, and all is good,
                    right? Then you have no destructor called as someone keeps the object alive,
                    right? Well, you still have a risk of a signal, callback, etc. </p><p>What you need is protect your object with a shared_ptr and have no other way
                    to access the object. Asynchronous provides this.</p><p>There are more lifetime issues, even without mutexes. If you have ever used
                    Boost.Asio, a common mistake and an easy one is when a callback is called in the
                    proactor thread after an asynchronous operation, but the object called is long
                    gone and the callback invalid. Asynchronous provides <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch03s03.html#trackable_servant">trackable_servant</a></strong></span> which makes sure
                    that a callback is not called if the object which called the asynchronous
                    operation is gone. It also prevents a task posted in a threadpool to be called
                    if this condition occurs, which improves performance. Some helper members even
                    make sure you get no crash, even while facing a Boost.Asio callback.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Shutting down&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Servant Proxies</td></tr></table></div></body></html>

                    scheduler is taboo as it blocks the thread doing all the management of a system.
                    But what to do when one needs to execute long tasks? Asynchronous provides a
                    whole set of threadpools. A servant posts something to a threadpool, provides a
                    callback, then gets a result. Wait a minute. Callback? Is this not
                    thread-unsafe? Why not threadpools with futures, like usual? Because in a
                    perfectly asynchronous world, waiting for a future means blocking a servant
                    scheduler. One would argue that it is possible not to block on the future, and
                    instead ask if there is a result. But frankly, polling is not a nice solution
                    either.</p><p>And what about thread-safety? Asynchronous takes care of this. A callback is
                    never called from a threadpool, but instead posted back to the queue of the
                    scheduler which posted the work. All the servant has to do, is to do nothing and
                    wait until the callback is executed. Note that this is not the same as a
                    blocking wait, the servant can still react to events.</p><p>Clearly, this brings some new challenges as the flow of control gets harder to
                    follow. This is why a servant is often written using state machines. The
                    (biased) author suggests to have a look at the <a class="link" href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/index.html" target="_top"> Meta State Machine library </a> , which plays nicely with
                    Asynchronous.</p><p>But what about the usual proactor issues (crashes) when the servant has long
                    been destroyed when the callback is posted. Gone. Asynchronous <span class="command"><strong><a name="trackable_servant"></a></strong></span><code class="code">trackable_servant</code> post_callback
                    ensures that a callback is not called if the servant is gone. Better even, if
                    the servant has been destroyed, an unstarted posted task will not be
                    executed.</p><p>What about another common issue? If one posts a task, say a lambda, which
                    captures a shared_ptr to an object per value, and this object is a
                    boost::signal? Then when the task object has been executed and is destroyed, one
                    could have a race on the signal deregistration. But again no. Asynchronous
                    ensures that a task created within a scheduler context gets destroyed in this
                    context.</p><p>This is about the best protection one can get. What Asynchronous cannot
                    protect from are self-made races within a task (if you post a task with a
                    pointer to the servant, you're on your own and have to protect your servant). A
                    good rule of thumb is to consider data passed to a task as moved or passed by
                    value. To support this, Asynchronous does not copy tasks but moves them.</p><p>Armed with these protections, let's give a try to a threadpool, starting with
                    the most basic one, <code class="code">threadpool_scheduler</code> (more to come):</p><pre class="programlisting">struct Servant : boost::asynchronous::trackable_servant&lt;&gt;
{
    Servant(boost::asynchronous::any_weak_scheduler&lt;&gt; scheduler)
        : boost::asynchronous::trackable_servant&lt;&gt;(scheduler,
                                               // <span class="bold"><strong>threadpool with 3 threads</strong></span> and a lockfree_queue
                                               boost::asynchronous::create_shared_scheduler_proxy(
                                                   new <span class="bold"><strong>boost::asynchronous::<span class="bold"><strong>threadpool_scheduler</strong></span></strong></span>&lt;
                                                           boost::asynchronous::lockfree_queue&lt;&gt; &gt;(<span class="bold"><strong>3</strong></span>))){}
    // call to this is posted and executes in our (safe) single-thread scheduler
    void start_async_work()
    {
       //ok, let's post some work and wait for an answer
       <span class="bold"><strong>post_callback</strong></span>(
                    [](){std::cout &lt;&lt; "Long Work" &lt;&lt; std::endl;}, // work, do not use "this" here
                    [/*this*/](boost::asynchronous::expected&lt;void&gt;){...}// callback. Safe to use "this" as callback is only called if Servant is alive
        );
    }
};</pre><p>We now have a servant, living in its own thread, which posts some long work to
                    a three-thread-threadpool and gets a callback, but only if still alive.
                    Similarly, the long work will be executed by the threadpool only if Servant is
                    alive by the time it starts. Everything else stays the same, one creates a proxy
                    for the servant and posts calls to its members, so we'll skip it for
                    conciseness, the complete example can be found <a class="link" href="examples/example_post_trackable_threadpool.cpp" target="_top">here</a>.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">A servant proxy&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;A servant using another servant proxy</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
